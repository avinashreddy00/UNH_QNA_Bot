The friendly, knowledgeable, and student-focused staff works closely with students to develop an individual career action plan that will lead to life-long career success. 
Through our Peer Career Advisors, a group of students trained to provide career assistance to their fellow students, career assistance is available in the residence halls, classrooms, library, and other locations around campus, including during evenings and weekends."

The Career Development Center has both people and resources to assist students in choosing a major or an academic course of study. Our experienced Career Advisors work individually with students to identify areas of interest and strength, and have conversations to begin focusing on academic programs that match. Your student can take FOCUS, a computer-assisted career guidance system that will suggest potential career areas to explore based on interests, abilities, personality, and values. It is always recommended that your student meet with a Career Advisor after taking FOCUS to discuss results and compose a plan for follow-up action. We also offer a one-credit course every Fall semester called ""Discovering Majors and Careers"" that guides students through the major selection process with weekly class meetings, career assessment activity, career exploration assignments, and conversations to illuminate major and career choices for each student.  Recently we became the first university in the nation to utilize an algorithm-based candidate matching system that allows employers to connect with students with the major, skills, and qualifications they seek, creating significant engagement opportunities for students with our employer partners."

Each year we host over 300 organizations on campus for recruiting purposes, post 1500+ jobs and internships, bring alumni back to campus to connect with students, and partner with faculty to develop contacts for students. We conduct a number of events designed to provide connections between students and employers including three major annual on-campus career fairs, employer information tables and sessions, on-campus interviewing, networking events, seminars, and professional development workshops, all free of charge for students."

Are there resources available?,"The Career Development Center assists with resumes by offering students opportunities to attend a resume-writing workshop, to submit their resume online for review, and to meet with a Career Advisor to learn how to build a great resume from scratch. Additionally, we partner with faculty across campus to conduct in-class resume workshops and work with staff, student groups, Athletics, and other programs to integrate resume and career development into their programs. The CDC staff has experience reviewing resumes in all degree programs, and stays abreast of employer preferences and feedback regarding resumes to ensure our students are successfully conveying their experiences and skills to employers in a format that produces results."
Does the University of New Haven offer assistance with interviewing?,"The Career Development Center has several resources available to students to help them learn and master interviewing skills. Students meet with a Career Advisor to learn the strategies behind a successful interview and begin practicing those strategies right away. Our staff will review important interviewing questions and conduct a mock interview so students get immediate feedback on their performance. Additionally, we offer an online mock interview system where students record themselves answering questions and submit those videos for review by the CDC staff.  Our Peer Career Advisors work with student clubs and organizations to provide interview training and workshops. Most importantly, through collaborations with several academic programs, students participate in professional mock interview events where employers and alumni come to campus to conduct mock interviews for students, providing a hands-on simulation with immediate feedback for students to practice this vital career management skill."
Is there any assistance available to my student who is looking to apply to graduate school?,"Yes. The Career Development Center helps students begin the application process for graduate school by providing information on how to research graduate and professional schools, exam preparation resources, personal statement reviews, and general application tips. The CDC, in collaboration with several departments on campus, hosts an annual Graduate School Week with a series of events, workshops, and information sessions to help students understand the graduate school, application process, write their personal statements, become acquainted with admissions requirements and exams, and learn how to finance graduate school. The CDC also collaborates with faculty advisors for pre-law and pre-med for specific student needs in applying to related professional programs.

Whether they are still abroad or have returned from their trip, s/he may contact Deputy Title IX Coordinator, Ophelie Rowe-Allen at orallen@newhaven.edu, for assistance."
Is there someone that can assist my student in contacting the police?,"University Police Department, the Dean of Students Office, and the College Advocate are all available to assist students in contacting the correct police department (based on jurisdiction and location of the misconduct). University PD and the Rape Crisis Center of Milford’s College Advocate can advise students on what to expect from a criminal police investigation."
Does my student have to immediately decide to press charges?,"No, but to keep legal options open, the University advises that it may be beneficial to receive medical attention and/or a sexual assault evidence kit. The College Advocate from the Rape Crisis Center of Milford, is available to accompany students to the hospital and support them throughout the medical and/or criminal process. If a reporting party would prefer to not undergo a rape kit, they may still want to seek medical treatment, emergency contraception, STI testing/treatment, and/or pregnancy testing through the University’s Health Services Center.
A sexual assault evidence collection kit may be administered at Milford Hospital, or Yale New Haven Hospital. If a reporting party chooses to undergo a rape kit, they are not required to cooperate with law enforcement or pursue criminal charges. However, only DNA evidence collected by a rape kit is admissible in court. This is a free service in the state of CT."
Is there an option that allows my student to report a sexual misconduct incident confidentially?,"Yes. Students may choose to speak to a licensed professional in Health Services, Counseling & Psychological Services, or a pastoral counselor in complete confidence. Students may choose to report anonymously online through the LiveSafe application or the Report It website. Please note that regardless of the form utilized, the information will be referred to the Title IX Coordinator for inquiry and investigation as appropriate. Community members are encouraged to include as many details as possible for all anonymous reports."
What types of assistance/remedies are available to my student?,"When a student makes a formal report of sexual misconduct, they will be informed of their options for reasonable accommodations and appropriate remedies to secure their safety and ability to engage in educational opportunities. Remedies may be in the form of ""no contact"" orders, changes in housing assignments and/or academic schedules. For more information on informal remedies/accommodations, contact Ashley Dunn, Director of Title IX VAWA Compliance at (203) 932-7445 or adunn@newhaven.edu."
Does my student have to tell the University who assaulted them?,"While the University does not require that a student disclose their responding party (""alleged""), it is important to note that withholding the responding party’s identity may affect the University’s ability to conduct a comprehensive inquiry and/or investigation."

Will there be a pre-departure orientation?,Yes! Students are REQUIRED to attend the Pre-Departure Orientation. It is held on campus during the semester prior to their semester abroad. Friends and family are welcome to join.
Will students be safe while they are studying abroad?,"We recognize that safety is a matter of utmost concern for parents when their child expresses an interest in studying in a foreign country. As part of our pre-departure orientation, parents and student wills be given an overview of the university’s various safety precautions, and what they can do personally to ensure they have a safe, fun, and enjoyable study abroad experience. In addition, once our students arrive in the pre-approved country of their choosing, they will again go through an extensive on-site orientation where safety precautions will again be reinforced. For the Prato campus, we have an after-hours emergency phone number available for students and all students can call the University of New Haven Police Department to receive assistance in the event of an emergency. We also enroll all of our students in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP), which will send important information from the Embassy about safety conditions in their destination country."
Who is responsible for students while they are studying abroad?,"The University does everything in our power to ensure all students are safe and healthy while abroad by providing comprehensive information before and during their experience. For Prato campus, we provide students with an Emergency Information Card before they depart containing a number of in-country personnel and other local emergency numbers for them to contact should they run into any difficulties. Non-Prato students can contact the University of New Haven Police Department for immediate assistance. Additionally, we have on-site staff to assist students as they adapt and acclimate to the host culture.

                                    

					Although we do everything we can to prepare students and keep them informed of health and safety information, it is ultimately the student’s responsibility to follow suggestions and guidelines, just as it is their responsibility at home campus."
How can someone get in touch with a student while they are abroad?,"There is a variety of ways to keep in touch with students. Most commonly families choose to use ""WhatsApp"" and ""Viber,"" which are international communication applications that provide text messaging, video calling and audio calls through the use of Wi-Fi.

What is a tuition differential fee?,"Tuition differentials are additional fees associated with particular courses. These courses (usually engineering, chemistry, and computer science courses) require additional resources to operate.  Tuition differential fees are noted on the Academic Schedule."
Why am I being charged a lab fee if I’m not taking a lab?,"Although the course in question does not necessarily have a laboratory component, there is an additional fee required to operate the class.  This fee is used to support courses requiring specialized materials and/or a specialized environment. Lab fees are noted on the Academic Schedule."
What happens if I do not pay my bill by the due date?,"If the payment is not received by the designated due date, you may be assessed a late fee as have a financial hold placed on your record.  This hold will restrict you from scheduling/registering for future classes, requesting transcripts, and receiving your diploma."
How can my parent or guardian have access to my bill?,"The University of New Haven fully complies with the provisions of FERPA and with its statements on policies and procedures.

										In order for staff to discuss any details of the student's bill with anyone other than the student, the person must be set up as an authorized payer in ePay.  Once someone is an authorized user, that person will have access to the tuition bill in ePay and will receive email notifications when a new bill is ready to be viewed."
What is FERPA?,"The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that affords parents the right to have access to their children’s education records, the right to seek to have the records amended, and the right to have some control over the disclosure of personally identifiable information from the education records.  When a student turns 18 years old, or enters a postsecondary institution at any age, the rights under FERPA transfer from the parents to the student (""eligible student""). The FERPA statute is found at 20 U.S.C. § 1232g and the FERPA regulations are found at 34 CFR Part 99. Read more about FERPA here."

Is the service fee refundable or can it be waived?,"The service fee is assessed by an outside vendor, not by the University of New Haven. The fee is not refundable and cannot be waived."
Do other Universities charge a service fee for credit and debit card payments?,Yes. Colleges and Universities across the country have made similar changes to their credit and debit card payment policies.  Some are choosing not to accept credit and debit card payments due to the additional costs associated with credit and debit card transactions.
How do I make a credit card payment if that remains my preferred payment method?,Credit and debit card payments can only be made online through ePay.  The University of New Haven will no longer process credit and debit cards in person at the Bursar’s Office or via phone.

The University health insurance plan is mandatory for all international students."

The loan amount I took out to cover my balance was more than what I owed. How and when can I receive a refund?,If a student has a Title IV (federal financial aid) credit on their account then a refund will be processed automatically within 14 days of the funds posting to a student’s account. If the credit on a students' account is not a Title IV credit then the student must request a refund by emailing the Bursar's Office.
What is the quickest way to receive my refund?,Students are strongly encouraged to enroll in direct deposit through ePay to have refunds deposited directly into their checking or savings account of their choice. Students can enroll in direct deposit by clicking on the Refunds menu option in ePay.
Does the University of New Haven offer financial aid to Graduate Students?,"Yes, the University of New Haven is committed to assisting our Graduate Students
									  in the financing of their education by offering a comprehensive financial aid program.
									  We try to meet the needs of Graduate aid applicants through a ""package"" of assistance,
									  generally consisting of:
Federal the Direct Unsubsidized Student Loan - The primary financial aid source for most graduate students. Student loans are
									  awarded to graduate students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens, are matriculated
									  and enrolled at least half-time (5 credits per term), and have completed the financial
									  aid application process.  Graduate students may be able to borrow up to $20,500 per
									  year in Federal Direct Student Loans, however this amount may be lower depending on
									  the student's enrollment plans or other financial assistance a student is receiving.  
									  Students are responsible for paying the interest on Unsubsidized loans.  You can opt
									  to make interest only payments once per quarter which will assist in reducing accumulated
									  interest. More information on the Federal Direct Student Loans can be found here."
How do I apply for aid?,"If you are applying for Graduate aid for any term in the 2022-2023 academic year (Fall 2022, Spring 2023) you are required to submit the 2022-2023 FAFSA. The FAFSA is available each year beginning October 1."
Will my financial aid cover my course costs?,"R. If students are eligible for the maximum student loans of $20,500 per academic year,
									  it will cover most of the cost for a full time course load for most  University of New Haven Graduate Degree Programs.  You should monitor your student
									  billing account on e-pay, the university's on-line student account system, to review
									  your current balance status. A current list of graduate charges is also available
									  on the Bursar's website.  Any excess financial aid funds, after tuition and fee charges are satisfied, will
									  be returned to students in the form of a refund from the Bursar's Office."
When will I receive my refund?,"A refund can only be issued when there is a credit on your account at the Bursar's
									  office (i.e. there is excess financial aid after all of your university tuition and
									  fee costs have been covered).  To expedite a refund, you need to make sure that all of your financial aid requirements are completed including submission of an accepted financial aid award, completion of a Federal Student Loan Master Promissory Note and/or Student Loan Entrance Counseling session (if required) and proper enrollment in the upcoming term. Failure to complete any of these procedures can result in delayed disbursements and refunds.
If all of your financial aid requirements are completed, your aid will disburse to
									  your account on the first day of the term.  If your federal aid creates a credit on
									  your account, the Bursar's office will generate a refund. Under federal regulations,
									  the Bursar's office has 14 days once a credit is created by your federal financial
									  aid to process a refund.  Traditionally our Bursar's office makes every effort to
									  expedite that process in a shorter timeframe. Refunds are processed on a weekly basis and are available for student pickup on Fridays
									  at the Bursar's Office. For more information regarding refunds click here."
Do I need to notify the Financial Aid Office if I add or drop a class?,"Yes. There are several reasons that you have to notify us that you have added or dropped a class:
1. Some loans and grant programs require you register for a specific number of credits each trimester. Federal Student loans are only available to students that are enrolled half-time or above (5 credits are
										  more) in any given term.  Our Graduate Assistantship positions are only available
										  to fulltime students (9 credits per term) with the only exception being the last term
										  of enrollment where the student may enroll half-time and still receive the Graduate
										  Assistantship grant for 50% of their tuition.
2. The number of credits you register for determines your enrollment status (ie. full
										  time, part time) and this in turn may affect the amount of financial aid you can receive. 
										  Your overall Cost of Attendance is derived by your enrollment status.
3. Satisfactory academic progress, a mandatory regulation for maintaining financial aid, may be affected by dropping classes.  You were awarded aid based on achieving a specific number of credits per
										  term (as stated in your financial aid award).  If you do not successfully earn those
										  credits at year end, when we check academic progress, you will be ineligible to receive
										  aid for the next academic year until those deficient credits are achieved. Students
										  have an opportunity to appeal their loss of eligibility.
Bottomline... before you change your schedule, drop a class or withdraw from a class,
											 you must notify the Financial Aid Office to determine if that change will affect your
											 eligibility for aid or your loan amounts."
What are the most common errors when applying for financial aid?,"Filing your application late - Incorrect Social Security Numbers –  Omitting the
										  school code 001397 on the FAFSA - Not using your legal name from your social security
										  card - Submitting illegible, incomplete, or unsigned documentation - Failing to report
										  other untaxed income such as child support, contributions to a 401k plan or an IRA,
										  etc. - Under reporting or failure to report student assets - Incorrect reporting of
										  number in household/college on the FAFSA. Please double check your FAFSA before submitting
										  it."
If I receive an outside scholarship must I notify the Financial Aid Office?,"Yes. Anytime a student receives funds from an outside company, employer, agency, or civic group they must report it to the University of New Haven Financial Aid Office."
Do I have to re-apply for financial aid every year?,"Yes. Financial aid is not automatic and must be reapplied for each year. You can file anytime after October 1, and our priority date to submit the FAFSA is January 1."
Who do I contact with additional questions or for more information on financial aid?,"The Financial Aid Office is located in Bergami Hall and is open from 8:30 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. Monday-Friday. We can also be reached at (203) 932-7315, or by email at financialaid@newhaven.edu."
